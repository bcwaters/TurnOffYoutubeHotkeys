# Remove Youtube Hotkeys
This is a simple extension that removes youtube hotkeys whenever on youtube.com

## Instructions
Install the extension from chrome store or this directory and now hotkeys are disabled by default
Click the icon to enable hotkeys again

## Contribute
I made this cause no else did yet and youtube doesnt give users the options to remove hotkeys
I don't plan on maintaining this really.

If you make a pull request that improves this I will merge it and and republish the extension in the store.
